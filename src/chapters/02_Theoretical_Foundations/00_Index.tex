\chapter{Theoretical Foundations}

This chapter delves into the theoretical foundations of two critical technologies in modern software development:
functional package management and containerization.
By examining the principles, architecture, and examples of these technologies,
we aim to build a comprehensive understanding that will inform the comparative analysis
and practical applications discussed in subsequent chapters.
